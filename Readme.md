# gooni

An attempt at writing OONI Probe in golang.

This is heavy work in progress.

## Development setup

This project uses `dep` with the `vendor/` dir in `.gitignore`.

Once you have `dep` installed, run:

```
dep ensure
```

You should then be able to build a ooni binary by running:

```
make build
```
